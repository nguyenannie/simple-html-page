                I am <strong>a proud cat lady</strong> who — if I were not forced to pack my life into a one-bedroom apartment — would aim to catch 'em all like Pokémon so I could constantly be accompanied by a lovable fur ball. 
            <p>
                Currently I have a male cat named Rubble and he is month-old. In the middle of December, I will welcome a new male cat named Sonic. By the time he arrives, he will be 3-month old.
